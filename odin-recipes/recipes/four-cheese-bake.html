         <h3>Description</h3>
         <p>This rich macaroni combines the savory flavors of Swiss, Monterey Jack, 
            sharp Cheddar, and Parmesan cheeses, along with sauteed garlic and onion 
            to make a creamy sauce to die for. Add a little liquid smoke for a, well, 
            smoky taste.</p>
